# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 
* Eric and I learned that it in our project using the agile process helped us immensely throughout to progress through the project. With each small chunk of functionality that we completed, it became easier to step back and evaluate how things went and where we wanted to go from there.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?
* Our project management tool was a github issue checklist based off the rubric and as we worked through the items we were able to check them off.

3. What role did you take on in the project? 
* I'm not sure, as a group it felt like we both took on the role that seemed appropriate and we did not run into a problem due to our more fluid approach. I would say that we both helped each other and that the roles were more superfluous this time around.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
* While I understand that no project is perfect and there is always room for improvement, I believe that both Eric and I worked very well together and that at this point I wouldn't change anything that we did.

5. How does retro function in a team project?
* Since we retroed every day and within that day we did a mini-retro after each project chunk, the takeaway that I had was that the more you communicate, the better your project will turn out. As we discussed the project on an hourly basis and evaluated where to go, I have found the retro to be a powerful tool that I would like to use to its fullest advantage.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?
* We did not follow the principles closely, since we both got along well and were professional in our feedback as well as not being personal in our approach, each conversation was directly about the project and not about what we were doing personally towards it. That being said, when behavior affected the project, it was brought up and discussed as to how to adjust accordingly and become better for it.

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
* I think that I did well on the feedback portion, though I also feel like there is room to improve on it as I go forward. Each time we evaluated during a retro, we took the opportunity to air any issues that could have crept in and addressed them so as to keep them from becoming a problem. I think I would improve my feedback by doing more of it, practice makes perfect.
